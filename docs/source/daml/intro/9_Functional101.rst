9 Functional Programming 101
============================

In this chapter, we will use both the Asset, as well as the Upgrade models from Chapter 8 to learn more about expressing complex logic in a functional language like DAML. You'll learn about

- Function signatures and functions
- Advanced control flow (if...else, folds, recursion)
- Important typeclasses like ``Fuctor``, ``Foldable``, and ``Traversable``
- Important types from the Standard Library, and associated functions and typeclasses
- How to search the Standard Library

If you no longer have your projects set up, please follow the setup instructions in :doc:`8_Upgrading` to get hold of the code for this chapter.
